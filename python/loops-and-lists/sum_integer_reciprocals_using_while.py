# Errors
# 1. Loop condition should have been 'index <= maximum_index'
# 2. Index variable was never included
# 3. added formatting?

#LLM Response Simulation
# When asked "What's wrong with this code?", a LLM responded
# "There are three issues:
# 1. The loop condition 'index < maximum_index' causes the loop to stop before reaching the maximum index.
#    To include 100 in the summation, the condition should be 'index <= maximum_index'.
# 2. The loop does not increment the 'index' variable, resulting in an infinite loop.
# 3. The final print statement lacks formatting to limit decimal precision, which may reduce readability."
